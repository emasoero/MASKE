# A default pseudo-potential table with all zeros is defined for all type combinations first. Then, MASKE will replace the pseudo-potential with the correct ones for the type combinations defined here.

# If the "micro" mechanism is of type "pair", then we must define eq_dist in distance units and cutoff in either distance or strain (to be decided). If "micro" is of type bonded particle method (BPM), then no eq_dist to be given and cutoff must be a fraction of the equilibrium distance. If "micro" is a pair with diameter-dependent potential, then both eq_dist and cutoff must be a fraction of diameter.

# format of generic row in table is: type_A, type_B, eq_dist, cutoff, E_interf
