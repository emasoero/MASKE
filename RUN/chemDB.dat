# MOLECULAR SPECIES
# molecule usr_def_name fgd_size_rad fgd_size_circ bkg_vol bkg_ahyd charge_num
# fgd_size are the linear sizes of the molecule when in a lammps particle, rad is in radial direction, circ in circumferential direction (this latter to power 2 gives area of attachment)
# bkg_vol is the apparent volume of one molecule when implicit in the background, typically in solution
# bkg_ahyd is the hydrated ion size of the moleculule in solution = molecule + coorinated water    (I found 0.42 nm for Ca2+, and I guessed the others..)
# charge_num  zi  is the charge number. E.g. for Ca2+ it is +2, and for H2SiO4 2- it is -2

It is weird to see a negative DG, but this is because the standard state of a solution is 1M, so very concentrated. The negative DGx will give a high exp(-DG/kT) in the rate, but then be compensated for precipitation by the activity product of the ions in solution
