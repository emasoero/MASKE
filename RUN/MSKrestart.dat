#	type can be: 
#		strict : the program returns an error if the exact step indicated is not found in the xyz file. Step must be indicated
#		loose : the program chooses the step indicated or the one immediately greater. Step must be indicated
#		first : the first timestep of the xyz file is chosen. Step must not be indicated
#		last : the last timestep of the xyz file is chosen. Step must not be indicated
